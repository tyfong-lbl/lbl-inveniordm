## Kubernetes Production Deployment Considerations

Moving from a localhost-only development setup to a production Kubernetes deployment involves significant architectural and security changes. Let me break this down:

## Key Architectural Shifts

### 1. **Network Security Model**
**Development**: All services bound to 127.0.0.1, no external access
**Production**: Need ingress controllers, load balancers, network policies

```yaml
# Example: Network policies to control inter-service communication
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: invenio-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: invenio-web
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx-ingress
```

### 2. **Certificate Management**
**Development**: Self-signed certificates in `~/.config/`
**Production**: Need proper CA-signed certificates or cert-manager

```yaml
# cert-manager for automatic TLS
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: lbnl-data-repository-tls
spec:
  secretName: lbnl-tls-secret
  issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  dnsNames:
  - data.lbl.gov
```

### 3. **Secret Management**
**Development**: Environment variables in shell scripts
**Production**: Kubernetes Secrets, possibly with external secret management

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: opensearch-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <base64-encoded>
  password: <base64-encoded>
```

## Critical Questions to Address

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- How will users authenticate? (LDAP, OIDC, SAML?)
- What's the user onboarding process?
- Role-based access control requirements?
- Integration with existing LBNL identity systems?

### **Data Persistence & Backup**
- Where will PostgreSQL data be stored? (PVCs, cloud databases?)
- OpenSearch index backup strategy?
- File storage for uploaded research data?
- Disaster recovery requirements?

### **Scalability & Performance**
- Expected concurrent users?
- Data volume growth projections?
- Auto-scaling requirements for web/worker pods?
- CDN needs for file downloads?

### **Compliance & Security**
- Data classification requirements?
- Audit logging needs?
- Network segmentation requirements?
- Vulnerability scanning and patching processes?

### **Operations & Monitoring**
- Log aggregation (ELK stack, Fluentd?)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana?)
- Alerting for service health?
- Database administration access?

## Suggested Migration Path

### Phase 1: Containerization
1. **Helm Charts**: Convert docker-compose to Kubernetes manifests
2. **ConfigMaps**: Externalize configuration
3. **PersistentVolumes**: Plan data storage strategy

### Phase 2: Security Hardening
1. **Pod Security Standards**: Implement security contexts
2. **RBAC**: Service accounts with minimal permissions  
3. **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation
4. **Image Security**: Vulnerability scanning, signed images

### Phase 3: Production Services
1. **Managed Databases**: Consider cloud PostgreSQL/OpenSearch
2. **Load Balancing**: Ingress controllers with SSL termination
3. **Service Mesh**: Consider Istio for advanced traffic management

### Phase 4: Operations
1. **GitOps**: ArgoCD or Flux for deployment automation
2. **Monitoring Stack**: Full observability suite
3. **Backup Automation**: Velero or similar

## Immediate Next Steps

**Would you like me to focus on any specific area?** For example:
- Draft Kubernetes manifests for your current services?
- Design a certificate management strategy?
- Plan the authentication integration?
- Outline monitoring and logging architecture?

**Also, what's your target environment?** 
- LBNL internal Kubernetes cluster?
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
- Hybrid setup?
